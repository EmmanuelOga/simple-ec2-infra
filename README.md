# Deploy highly available Infrastructure on EC2 with Docker Compose

AWS EC2 features "autoscaling groups", a way to setup EC2 to spawn up instances as necessary.

We can setup an AWS elastic load balancer in front of the group to distribute traffic. Each EC2 instance should be running the same docker images. We can use Traefik to automatically discover containers to serve HTTP traffic from (or not... the same setup can be used to run, say, background jobs).

We'll use docker-compose to spawn up a group of docker containers. The `docker-compose.yml` file will be copied to EC2 servers from an S3 bucket.

This example uses an ASG of 1 instance. AWS supports setting up alarms and scaling out on high CPU usage and other metrics. CDK allows setting this up and can be easily added to the deploy script if required. Also, while it is possible to deploy to multiple regions with the same script, here we just do it to a single region, in multiple availability zones.

The rollout uses the cool [docker-rollout](https://github.com/Wowu/docker-rollout) plugin by @Wowu, which is a short script that spawns a new replica of a docker compose service, waits for it to be healthy, and then kills the old replica containers.

*NOTE*: having an ASG of 1 instance is still useful as AWS can restart the instance if it dies, for whatever reason, even if you manually stop it!

## Requirements:

* A running [AWS CLI app](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/).
* A bootstrapped [CDK installation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_bootstrap) (see also [CDK Workshop](https://cdkworkshop.com/)).
* Docker.

## Bootstrap

The deploy script needs an S3 bucket and ECR repo to work. This can be done from the amazon console, or by running the following commands.

NOTE: we don't create these resources at deploy time since the script assumes these already exist. Also CDK owns everything it creates, so it is nice to keep these two resources human-controlled.

1. Configure env variables. For instance, with an .env file like this:
```sh
SINFRA_STACK_NAME=myapp-infra
SINFRA_S3_BUCKET=myapp-deploy-config
SINFRA_ECR_REPO=myapp-deploy-repo
```

Run:
```sh
$ source .env
# or:
$ export $(xargs <.env)
```

2. Create an s3 bucket.
```sh
$ aws s3 mb s3://$SINFRA_S3_BUCKET
```

3. Copy a docker compose file to the bucket. Here we use an example one.
```sh
$ aws s3 cp assets/example/docker-compose.yml s3://$SINFRA_S3_BUCKET/docker-compose.yml
```

4. Create an ECR repository.
```sh
$ aws ecr create-repository --repository-name $SINFRA_ECR_REPO --region $(aws-scripts/ec2-region)
```

5. Run the CDK script to create the infrastructure (the script requires the previous env vars).
```sh
$ cd update-infra && npm run cdk deploy 
```

6. Open load-balancer url from the CDK output, you should see the application running.

NOTE: the repo just sets up HTTP, so make sure to load http and not https for the url on your browser.

## How to SSH into the EC2 instance/s

We can connect to the machine/s without opening port 22, through AWS Systems Manager agent. See https://cloudonaut.io/connect-to-your-ec2-instance-using-ssh-the-modern-way/ for more information.

Add the following configuration in your local `.ssh/config`, then connect with `ssh i-*`, where i-* is the instance id:
```sh
# SSH AWS instance over Session Manager.
host i-*
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
  User ec2-user
  ProxyCommand sh -c "aws ec2-instance-connect send-ssh-public-key --instance-id %h --instance-os-user %r --ssh-public-key 'file://~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub' --availability-zone '$(aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids %h --query 'Reservations[0].Instances[0].Placement.AvailabilityZone' --output text)' && aws ssm start-session --target %h --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession --parameters 'portNumber=%p'"
```
*NOTE*: make sure your are using your own key pair, i'm using `id_ed25519` and `id_ed25519.pub` here.

You can retrieve a list of all EC2 instances on autoscale groups with:

```sh
$ aws autoscaling describe-auto-scaling-instances --instance-ids
{
    "AutoScalingInstances": [ { "InstanceId": "i-123456789abcdefgh", ... }, ... ]
}
```

Now if I ssh into the instance name, the proxy command is triggered:
```sh
$ ssh i-123456789abcdefgh # Profit :-)
```

## Rolling deploys

To perform rolling deploys, we need to update the docker-compose.yml file, upload to S3, then ask each server in the autoscaling group to rollout the new container. The ECR repo comes handy here: we can push the built container there, and point to it from the docker-compose.yml file. Every EC2 instance should be authorized to pull from it.

When the deploy finished, it should include the name of the autoscaling group (or you can get it from the EC2 web console):

```sh
Outputs:
myapp-infra.SimpleInfraautoscalinggroupnameDA263BD6 = myapp-infra-SimpleInfraasgASG12566E13-eBG0OeU1FTYA
myapp-infra.SimpleInfraloadbalancerurlA16143A4 = myapp--Simpl-vWIhiQbUsj7z-464640336.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com
myapp-infra.SimpleInfrarepositoryurl41B3F834 = 639664408142.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/myapp-deploy-repo
Stack ARN:
arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:639664408142:stack/myapp-infra/0963f8f0-d04d-11ee-b18c-02b2bb8516b1

âœ¨  Total time: 4.02s
```

Now we can export the name to a variable to keep it around:

```sh
$ export SINFRA_ASG_NAME=myapp-infra-SimpleInfraasgASG12566E13-eBG0OeU1FTYA
```

With that, we can call the script to get the instance ids (requires [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq) installed).

```sh
$ aws-scripts/asg-instances
i-0c22ce6694c6d5152,i-0db64de0ebfa7d83c
```

Change the docker-compose.yml to point to the new version of your containers.
The rollout script updates only one service defined on the compose file at once.
In this example, I will rollout the 'whoami' service with a script:

```sh
$ vim assets/example.docker-compose.yml # Update the docker compose service.
$ aws s3 cp assets/example/docker-compose.yml s3://$SINFRA_S3_BUCKET/docker-compose.yml # We need to update the changes to S3.
$ aws-scripts/asg-rollout # Rollout the changes.
```

NOTE: we use S3 for the config file since it is highly available. The EC2 instances of the ASG are configured to automatically download the compose file from there if they need to restart or create a new instance.

The SINFRA_ECR_REPO is also useful if you want to push your own image to a private repo managed by AWS. Since we gave them the right IAM roles, both the server and your user should be able to push and pull from the repo.

## Adjusting the infrastructure.

CDK deploys uses CloudFormation, which is declarative. To perform infrastructure changes, we can simply modify the `update-infra/deploy.ts` script and re-deploy (`npm run cdk deploy`). Most of the times these changes can be performed in place, although in my experience sometimes is necessary to recreate the infra when we change things like VPC configurations in a way that CloudFormation can't fix. But things like changing number or type of instances just work.

Also you can change some settings from the EC2 console directly. For instance, in the EC2 tab, go to the autoscale-group and you will be able to change the desired number of instances to grow or shrink the group as needed.

## Tangent: AWS NAT gateway "tax" and insane egress costs

Beware amazon's NAT gateway "tax" and [insane egress costs](https://blog.cloudflare.com/aws-egregious-egress). For an alternative to using NAT gateways, consider adding [fck-nat](https://fck-nat.dev/) or setting everything up in public VPCs, as done by `deploy.ts` in this repo. (although in that case Amazon will [charge you monthly for all IPv4s used](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-public-ipv4-address-charge-public-ip-insights/)).
